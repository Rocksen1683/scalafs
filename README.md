# ScalaFS 
`ScalaFS` is a fault-tolerant distributed file system written in Scala and is designed to efficiently store and manage large-scale data across multiple nodes.

The file system uses a `NameNode` for metadata management and has a `DataNode` structure to handle the actual storage and replication of data blocks.
